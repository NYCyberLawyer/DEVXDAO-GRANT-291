In terms of how regulators are trying to approach DAO's and mitigate risk, basically, ultimately, which is the better jurisdiction to incorporate or to register a DAO? And why, if at all? so it's good to get a talk with you. Thank you for taking the time. 

Brittany Kaiser 0:20
Absolutely. 

Paul McCulloch 0:31
So do you want to just say your name and just let me know, let us know what some of your experiences have been with DAO's?

Brittany Kaiser 0:29
Yeah, of course. So before I was ever involved in any DAO's, I actually worked on the Wyoming LLC law. So my first exposure besides knowing about ones that existed or there were only a few and then with the law,  we started drafting that in 2018, I believe we passed it in 2019, I can double check. But there are only a few examples even point to at that time. So conceptually, the point was development of a corporate architecture where decision making could be encouraged but also transparent. Basically, be able to speed decision making, but also to encourage, you know, corporate governance participation in a way and you know, we started out with thinking that 99, a 99 person, Max for voting...

[Short Interrruption]

Brittany Kaiser 5:20
We can continue now. 

Paul McCulloch 5:26
All right. So I guess we left off with what experience you have with DAO's and

Brittany Kaiser 5:29
Right. So besides working on the DAO LLC law, since then, I have been participating in a number of different DAO's. One which has become a very successful model is the investment DAO. I think some of the best examples out there are the LAO, Spacious DAO, founders of each of those created an investment DAO that I'm part of. It's really great to have transparency over deal flow and decision making for you know, investment allocation within funds. So I think that's been a really great application. The second is just again for more transparent corporate governance, which is really the idea of the DAO LLC legislative initiative, which is, you know, now that we have all these blockchain companies from all around the world registering for LLCs in Wyoming after we passed the first few laws, it's like okay, well, you know, creating the ability for people around the world to live in the same place to be able to still corporately govern together and to vote and participate in decision making, you know, in a decentralized manner, and not perhaps even all participating in live meetings, but having a period of time for which they can make their vote after reviewing materials that  actually was going to be a more and more common models, so many technology companies, not just not just digital asset companies, but especially digital asset companies were had decentralized teams. So yeah, so I've, I've participated in some companies that have used DAO's mostly for voting. And then in philanthropic DAO's. so bringing transparency to philanthropic giving and donations, so being able to take in money into a treasury and have the members of the DAO deciding how, how either nonprofits or other eligible impact causes can receive funds and what they should do in order to verify that those funds have gone to the things they say they're supposed to go to. I think those are pretty good examples. And then, you know, as an NFT collector I've been a part of multiple NFT DAO's, where you know, your NFT is your membership token, and you have the ability to vote on how treasury funds are used, whether thats for branding and marketing for the projects or in real life events or whatever it happens to be. We've also helped co found a new DAO called Archeo DAO which is specifically for people who want to co own historic buildings and do the renovation. And upkeep together as a group.

Paul McCulloch 8:23
That sounds pretty awesome. Sounds like you've got a pretty good knowledge of the different ways that DAO's can be used 

Brittany Kaiser 8:32
so far 

Paul McCulloch 8:33
so far. That's actually pretty great. So then, I guess that takes us to the next question. You've been involved in many DAO's and some DAO's succeed while others fail. So what do you think are the top three things that contribute to a DAO's failure or success or in other words, if, you know, if you don't want to go with me on 123, What does the perfect DAO look like to you?

brittany Kaiser 8:58
So let me talk through the different lines of thinking here, which is that the success of the DAO should be that the DAO has allowed speed and transparency in decision making within organizations. The failure of some DAO's is when the opposite happens for a variety of reasons, and that can be that too many members are actually not participating in the voting process, or the voting rights have been corrupted because too many people have banded together in the background, or purchase too many governance tokens which actually give them larger voting rights than a single person should be able to have. And so I think, a perfect DAO, that's still something that a lot of people are trying to work on, but in general, being able to have a DAO architecture where you have put together enough checks and balances to stop people from being able to usurp power and to be able to have, you know, clear governance in a way where people understand how they can participate that they can get rewarded for participating. But, you know, whales or people with an extraordinary amount of economic power can come in and buy all of the power. You know, like you can in public markets, for example, cause the point of DAO's is supposed to be to improve what we improve upon what we already have there in the marketplace. So you can't get a DAO to function as well as the company does then what's the point? So, in an ideal world, the encouragement of participation so that you can continue to get voting members to engage and to participate so there's good corporate governance. And yeah, being able to block out bad actors from usurping control, are I would say are the bigger ideals that haven't been fully solved for most DAO architectures,

Paul McCulloch 11:03
yes. That's my experience. I've also seen a lot of that I've seen actually people equate DAO's to just thinly veiled oligarchies or just companies, people are running companies and calling it a DAO. And it's very interesting that those are those strike at the core of what would make a good DAO proper governance model and thank you for sharing. So, the next question is, so DAO's can present risks to participants, sectors, and associated industries. What I mean by that is vendors and if a DAO signs a contract with another entity. What do you believe is the legislative intent of many regulatory efforts for DAO's? In other words, what are the risks that you see regulators recognize and want to address?

Brittany Kaiser 11:55
So multiple risks, but I would say right now the most salient risk is definitely that governance tokens can be considered securities, even though it's just a way of signifying your right to vote. So that is a really big danger. That's the SEC's fault, no one else. Many other countries in the world are very happy for corporate governance tokens not be regulated as security since they're not. They obviously serve a function, but that's also risk that comes from industry. So a really good which that I talked about on the panel up on the Limitless, which I will try to get you the audio for, was Ukraine DAO. So Ukraine DAO, I was co founded by many different people. But one of my firends, Alana Shevchenko is the main founder. She, everyone that donated to Ukraine DAO was supposed to get LOVE tokens as their governance tokens so that they could access the discord, vote on how funds should be used, And then without her asking, or pursuing any of this, all of these exchanges started list listing the Love Token and so she spent many weeks calling every single exchange to try to get them to delist because she didn't want this to be something that people only donated to in order to make speculative money off of the governance token and that caused a lot of issues with how they were actually running the project. And they ended up having to remove the tokens from use completely. And basically use a Notion board and a Discord in order to manage their work and they couldn't even have the governance token as a part of it because it became such an issue. So that's a good example of where there are unfortunate risks due to governance tokens also possibly being speculative assets or possibly securities depending on which regulator is looking at it. I would say that's the biggest risk of the DAO architecture just because it brings that part of the equation into it for DAO's that don't intend for the governance token to have value. Now, if you look at the the fund model, were using a DAO for managing deal flow and making choices on where the investment is going. Now, the way that a lot of these funds start is they raise, they raise equity into the company but you can't. When you first invest, you get illiquid equity that you might not be able to, you know, cash out over three to five years depending on what you've agreed to. And so as the value of the equities and tokens that are invested into from the DAO goes up usually so does the price of the governance tokens. And so a lot of these models are offering you, you know, an equity to token liquidity event. So if you don't want to wait three to five years for your equity to become liquid or for the fund to sell and have some sort of equity based liquidity event, you can trade your equity for tokens and sell those on the public exchanges. Right. And so that's obviously creating the problem for DAO's that don't want to have governance tokens as speculative assets. So I feel like that's the confusion between those different models and how it's good for some models and terrible for others is what is you know, going to be kind of like the the main sticking point I think from from a regulatory perspective and what regulators are trying to regulate for but they're trying to regulate things that are completely different. You know, obviously, regulations for investment funds, regulations for nonprofits, regulations for different  types of companies are all different. But They're all trying to use the DAO and the DAO is being applied in completely different ways. So just that the functionality of the digital asset itself is I would say the biggest question, you know, can people create a token that cannot be listed on exchanges? That might be the only way to have like a governance token that will not be subject to, you know, securities regulation like how can you, can you use a governance token model where no one can go and sell their governance tokens? I don't know. But it's going to be required for certain certain types of entities to  choose a DAO model.

Paul McCulloch 16:57
That definitely makes sense. I think that you know, you try and think about the perfect governance token if it can't be transferred, then you've got that does somewhat address the issue, but if you're transferring, you're just  giving a key to someone else and other person has and the DAO is anonymous, for example, then, how do you know that you know the DAO, the governance token hasn't been transferred, transferred pursuant to some sort of side letter outside of any sort of smart contracts? So I think people are ingenious and they'll keep on trying to find a way and I'm glad that there are people like you that are trying to find ways to keep ahead of everyone else. So then, the last question is, if you were part of a DAO, which I know you're part of many DAO's, would you suggest they incorporate in one or another jurisdiction and if so, which one and why?

Brittany Kaiser 17:54
It depends what they're trying to accomplish. I think yeah, if you if you have founders that are American or you seek to do business in America, then Wyoming is your best choice. I would say because of the governance token issue, you would have to be very, very careful about how your governance token interacts with public markets, you know, that you're never trying to create, you know, a fluctuating price for your governance token -  like anything that you can do to make it clear that the point of releasing a governance token is for voting and for participation and governance and it's has nothing to do with people being able to sell it. You don't create any model for people to be able to sell it but okay, but otherwise, you know, I see a lot of people that have been creating DAO's in Switzerland or Caymans or a few other places, which I think makes sense, you know, better safe than sorry right now, with all the issues we're having with Gensler. Yeah, but it makes me sad to say that

Paul McCulloch 19:12
Yeahm it seems like regulatory clarity in every jurisdiction would be good, but you know, it's piecemeal. And I know that the Wyoming DAO legislation was really good step in the right direction. So just kind of building upon just the last part of that last question. That was for governance DAO's. Now, what about a fund DAO? Do you know? Your experience which, if the token is going to be a security, Where would you incorporate it and why? If at all.

Brittany Kaiser 19:47
so if it was meant to be a security then great, stay in the US - WYOMING for sure. There's not very many places where there is actual DAO legislation. So you can try to run your company on a DAO but actually the way that companies function in terms of the legislation doesn't, doesn't talk about many different issues or the amount of people that you're giving votes to that that legislation  specifically allows for participation. So,  I would struggle to say that you should start a DAO  anywhere that doesn't have a DAO law. That doesn't make any sense. But I know there's still a lot of people that are hesitant to even incorporate DAO's because they feel like even DAO legislation doesn't doesn't cover the maybe 1000s or 10s of 1000s of members that they want to be able to vote. There's no legislation that covers that right now. You know,

Paul McCulloch 20:51
That's the next step? Yeah. So I think that covers all of our questions. I wanted to say thank you for taking the time. I know you've got a lot going on and I really appreciate it and I'm sure that the DAO appreciates and and yeah thanks again. 

Brittany Kaiser 21:06
Awesome.
