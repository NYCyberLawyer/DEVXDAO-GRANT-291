Speaker 1 
 Okay. Good afternoon. It's 4 15 on thursday november 17th. Uh and this call is being recorded. Thank you very much for taking the time for this phone call. Um And


00:23
Speaker 1 
 We're speaking with Tara Nethercott who is the part of Senate District four, who was involved in the drafting of the DAO legislation? How are you today?

00:36
Speaker 2 
 Good, good. How are you

00:37
Speaker 1 
 doing well? Thanks. I really appreciate you taking the time for this and for all the members of the DAO. So as mentioned in our prior conversations leading up to here, there's primarily three questions um about the legislation and the first is a very broad question and feel free to answer it is as short, as long as you would like, but what was the intent, initial intent of the legislation?

01:07
Speaker 2 
 The high level intent of the legislation was to provide. a legislative framework or a legal framework that was responding to the desires of. people and businesses,  in our state and country and world, for how to possibly create a new different type of business entity, recognizing the desire of those interested parties, uh for a decentralized. uh autonomous type of organization and so pretty cutting edge and pioneering on that front. And so getting our arms around that desire, um hearing from stakeholders or constituents about the need for this type of entity creation. And so we responded to those concerns by creating the DAO.

02:07
Speaker 1 
 That's fantastic. Thank you very much for that. And there's, as you may uh have seen um in the news lately, or even with DAO's, again, one of the questions on a consistent basis has been regarding governance. Um are there any governance issues that specifically like to comment on that were addressed with legislation? Or are there any issues that you've seen since the legislation regarding governance that you could speak to?

02:44
Speaker 2 
 Sure there are, there's been a number of conversations um from the inception and that continue concerning governance. Since this is generally a new concept and a new entity created under the law. It's important to reevaluate regularly, um whether or not it works, um and how we need to do it differently, and who's really in charge of? And so this last 2022 legislative session, We amended essentially the bill that we had passed in 2021 to provide further clarity regarding member managed or algorithm algorithmically managed, um members of the DAO to kind of determine who makes decisions or how those decisions are made by a majority of the members of the DAO, um and distinguishing that from a membership interest. Uh And so those conversations are happening regularly, but I think it's important to recognize that a DAO like any other corporate entity has the flexibility to be governed based on the consent of its members. And that just depends upon the operating agreement um. of those members.

04:12
Speaker 1 
 And that's that's spot on. Very accurate. I've seen that as the  attorney sort of DAO, there's a lot of considerations go into the operating agreement. So, thank you for that comment. And the last question is,

04:32
Speaker 1 
Can you comment on the lessons learned since the passing of the law?

04:39
Speaker 2 
 I don't know that we have a full appreciation of lessons learned per say, there's certainly no uh negative experiences that I'm aware of to have any kind of hard lessons, but as stakeholders and interested parties come together to create their DAO in understanding where gaps may exist and understanding, we're further clarification may be necessary. And so that's you see, uh, the amendments that were made for the law this past year. Uh, and I anticipate that those conversations will continue uh. in the near future. And and in perpetuity really, it's not, it is normal for laws to be re evaluated based on best practices and it's just more efficient or thoughtful ways to do things. And so that won't be any different for the DAO bill as well.

05:38
Speaker 1 
 Well, that is that's fantastic. That's uh thank you very much for your answer. Thank you very much for your time.
